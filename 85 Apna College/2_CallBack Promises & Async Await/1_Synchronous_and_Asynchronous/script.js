Sync in JS

Synchronus
Synchronus means the code runs in particular sequence of instructions given
in the program.
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete
its execution.


Asynchronous
Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instruct get
blocked due to previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions
immediately and doesn't the flow.
